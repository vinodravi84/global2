		If human fails to put a halt to carbon emissions— the biggest cause of climate change— it is going to have a catastrophic impact on the planet's climate. Any further increase in carbon emissions will add to the extremities of weather events — the intensity of rainfalls will increase leading to widespread floods, the sea level will rise leading to flooding in coastal areas, heatwaves in tropical regions will claim more lives and make humans less productive.
		Earth’s average temperature has been steadily rising ever since humans started burning fossil fuels following Industrial Revolution leading to a rise in the level of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
		Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the Earth’s average temperature has steadily risen. Human activities have already warmed the Earth’s average temperature by 0.8°C to 1°C. If these activities continue unchecked, there is a possibility that the temperature would cross 1.5°C mark and even breach 2°C.<br><br>
	
		The pre-industrial levels is the baseline when the scientist assume that the effect of human-induced climate change was theoretically zero.
		The 2015 Paris Agreement by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control (IPCC) selected the period of 1850-1900 — almost 100 years after the start of Industrial Revolution — as baseline since the global temperature records started at that time. Though IPCC refrained from formally defining it is a “pre-industrial”.
		There is another school of thought which argues that the baseline should be 1720-1800 as a major natural factors affecting the Earth's climate at that time are very similar to the climatic conditions being observed today.
		Irrespective of the baseline one focuses on all theories have been unanimous in concluding that the planet's temperature has risen drastically in the last few decades.<br><br>

		Past emissions alone are unlikely to raise global-mean temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels
		 (medium confidence), but past emissions do commit to other changes, such as further sea level rise 
		 (high confidence). If all anthropogenic emissions (including aerosol-related) were reduced to zero 
		 immediately, any further warming beyond the 1°C already experienced would likely be less than 0.5°C 
		 over the next two to three decades (high confidence), and likely less than 0.5°C on a century time 
		 scale (medium confidence), due to the opposing effects of different climate processes and drivers. 
		 A warming greater than 1.5°C is therefore not geophysically unavoidable: whether it will occur 
		 depends on future rates of emission reductions.<br><br>

		1.5°C emission pathways are defined as those that, given current knowledge of the climate response, 
		provide a one- in-two to two-in-three chance of warming either remaining below 1.5°C or returning to 
		1.5°C by around 2100 following an overshoot. Overshoot pathways are characterized by the peak magnitude
		 of the overshoot, which may have implications for impacts. All 1.5°C pathways involve limiting 
		 cumulative emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide,
		  and substantial reductions in other climate forcers (high confidence). Limiting cumulative 
		  emissions requires either reducing net global emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases to zero 
		  before the cumulative limit is reached, or net negative global emissions (anthropogenic removals)
		   after the limit is exceeded.<br><br>

		This report assesses projected impacts at a global average warming of 1.5°C and higher levels of
		 warming. Global warming of 1.5°C is associated with global average surface temperatures fluctuating
		  naturally on either side of 1.5°C, together with warming substantially greater than 1.5°C in many 
		  regions and seasons (high confidence), all of which must be considered in the assessment of impacts.
		   Impacts at 1.5°C of warming also depend on the emission pathway to 1.5°C. Very different impacts
		    result from pathways that remain below 1.5°C versus pathways that return to 1.5°C after a 
			substantial overshoot, and when temperatures stabilize at 1.5°C versus a transient warming 
			past 1.5°C (medium confidence).<br><br>

		Ethical considerations, and the principle of equity in particular, are central to this report, 
		recognizing that many of the impacts of warming up to and beyond 1.5°C, and some potential impacts 
		of mitigation actions required to limit warming to 1.5°C, fall disproportionately on the poor and 
		vulnerable (high confidence). Equity has procedural and distributive dimensions and requires fairness 
		in burden sharing both between generations and between and within nations. In framing the objective 
		of holding the increase in the global average temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial 
		levels, and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C, the Paris Agreement associates the principle 
		of equity with the broader goals of poverty eradication and sustainable development, recognising that 
		effective responses to climate change require a global collective effort that may be guided by the 
		2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br>

		Climate adaptation refers to the actions taken to manage impacts of climate change by reducing 
		vulnerability and exposure to its harmful effects and exploiting any potential benefits. Adaptation 
		takes place at international, national and local levels. Subnational jurisdictions and entities, 
		including urban and rural municipalities, are key to developing and reinforcing measures for 
		reducing weather- and climate-related risks. Adaptation implementation faces several barriers 
		including lack of up-to-date and locally relevant information, lack of finance and technology, 
		social values and attitudes, and institutional constraints (high confidence). Adaptation is more
		 likely to contribute to sustainable development when policies align with mitigation and poverty 
		 eradication goals (medium confidence).<br><br>
