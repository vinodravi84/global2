			<h2>Speak Up!</h2>
			

			What’s the single biggest way you can make an impact on global climate change? “Talk to your friends 
			and family, and make sure your representatives are making good decisions,” Haq says. By voicing your 
			concerns—via social media or, better yet, directly to your elected officials—you send a message that 
			you care about the warming world. Encourage Congress to enact new laws that limit carbon emissions 
			and require polluters to pay for the emissions they produce. “The main reason elected officials do 
			anything difficult is because their constituents make them,” Haq says. You can help protect public 
			lands, stop offshore drilling, and more here.<br><br>

			<h2>Power your home with renewable energy</h2>
			Choose a utility company that generates at least half its power from wind or solar and has been certified 
			by Green-e Energy, an organization that vets renewable energy options. If that isn’t possible for you, 
			take a look at your electric bill; many utilities now list other ways to support renewable sources on 
			their monthly statements and websites.<br><br>


			 <h2>Weatherize, weatherize, weatherize</h2>
			 “Building heating and cooling are among the biggest uses of energy,” Haq says. Indeed, heating and 
			 air-conditioning account for almost half of home energy use. You can make your space more energy 
			 efficient by sealing drafts and ensuring it’s adequately insulated. You can also claim federal tax 
			 credits for many energy efficiency home improvements. To help you figure out where to start, you 
			 could also get a home energy audit, which some utilities offer free of charge (alternatively, you
			  can hire a professional to come to your home and perform one). The EPA’s Home Energy Yardstick 
			  gives you a simple assessment of your home’s annual energy use compared with similar homes.<br><br>

			<h2>Invest in energy-efficient appliances</h2>
			Since they were first implemented nationally in 1987, efficiency standards for dozens of appliances and 
			products have kept 2.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide out of the air. That’s about the same amount as 
			the annual carbon pollution coughed up by nearly 440 million cars. “Energy efficiency is the lowest-cost 
			way to reduce emissions,” Haq says. When shopping for refrigerators, washing machines, heat pump water 
			heaters, and other appliances, look for the Energy Star label. It will tell you which are the most 
			efficient. (There may also be rebates to earn from your purchase of Energy Star–certified products.)<br><br>

			<h2>Reduce water waste</h2>
			Saving water reduces carbon pollution, too. That's because it takes a lot of energy to pump, heat, and 
			treat your water. So take shorter showers, turn off the tap while brushing your teeth, and switch to 
			WaterSense-labeled fixtures and appliances. The EPA estimates that if just one out of every 100 
			American homes were retrofitted with water-efficient fixtures, about 100 million kilowatt-hours 
			of electricity per year would be saved—avoiding 80,000 tons of global warming pollution.<br><br>

			 <h2>Buy better bulbs</h2>
			 LED light bulbs use one-sixth the amount of energy to deliver the same amount of light as 
			 conventional incandescents and last at least 10 times longer. They’re also cheaper in the long run: 
			 A 10-watt LED that replaces your traditional 60-watt bulb will save you $125 over the ligh bulb’s 
			 life. And because the average American home has around 40 to 50 light bulbs, this is a simple swap
			  that will reap huge rewards. If every household in the United States replaced just one incandescent 
			  with an Energy Star–labeled LED, we would prevent seven billion pounds of carbon pollution per year. 
			  That’s equivalent to the emissions of about 648,000 cars.<br><br>

			<h2> Pull the plug(s).</h2>
			Taken together, the outlets in your home are likely powering about 65 devices—an average load for a 
			home in the United States. Audio and video devices, cordless vacuums and power tools, and other 
			electronics use energy even when they're not charging. This "idle load" across all U.S. households 
			adds up to the output of 50 large power plants in the country. So don't leave fully charged devices 
			plugged into your home's outlets, unplug rarely used devices or plug them into power strips and timers,
			 and adjust your computers and monitors to automatically power down to the lowest power mode when not 
			 in use.<br><br>


			<h2>Drive a fuel-efficient vehicle</h2>
			Gas-smart cars, such as hybrids and fully electric vehicles, save fuel and money. And once all 
			cars and light trucks meet 2025’s clean car standards, which means averaging 54.5 miles per 
			gallon, they’ll be a mainstay. For good reason: Relative to a national fleet of vehicles that
			 averaged only 28.3 miles per gallon in 2011, Americans will spend $80 billion less at the
			  pump each year and cut their automotive emissions by half. Before you buy a new set of wheels, 
			  compare fuel-economy performance here.<br><br>
