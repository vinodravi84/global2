			<h2>Hotter Temperatures</h2>
			

			As greenhouse gas concentrations rise, so does the global surface temperature. The last 
			decade, 2011-2020, is the warmest on record. Since the 1980s, each decade has been warmer 
			than the previous one. Nearly all land areas are seeing more hot days and heat waves. Higher 
			temperatures increase heat-related illnesses and make working outdoors more difficult. 
			Wildfires start more easily and spread more rapidly when conditions are hotter. Temperatures 
			in the Arctic have warmed at least twice as fast as the global average.<br><br>

			<h2>More Severe Storms</h2>
			Destructive storms have become more intense and more frequent in many regions. As temperatures 
			rise, more moisture evaporates, which exacerbates extreme rainfall and flooding, causing more 
			destructive storms. The frequency and extent of tropical storms is also affected by the warming
			 ocean. Cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons feed on warm waters at the ocean surface. Such storms
			  often destroy homes and communities, causing deaths and huge economic losses.<br><br>


			 <h2>Increased Droughts</h2>
			 Climate change is changing water availability, making it scarcer in more regions. Global warming 
			 exacerbates water shortages in already water-stressed regions and is leading to an increased risk
			  of agricultural droughts affecting crops, and ecological droughts increasing the vulnerability 
			  of ecosystems. Droughts can also stir destructive sand and dust storms that can move billions 
			  of tons of sand across continents. Deserts are expanding, reducing land for growing food. Many 
			  people now face the threat of not having enough water on a regular basis.<br><br>

			<h2>A warming, rising ocean</h2>
			The ocean soaks up most of the heat from global warming. The rate at which the ocean is warming 
			strongly increased over the past two decades, across all depths of the ocean. As the ocean warms,
			 its volume increases since water expands as it gets warmer. Melting ice sheets also cause sea 
			 levels to rise, threatening coastal and island communities. In addition, the ocean absorbs carbon 
			 dioxide, keeping it from the atmosphere. But more carbon dioxide makes the ocean more acidic, 
			 which endangers marine life and coral reefs.<br><br>

			<h2>Loss of Species</h2>
			Climate change poses risks to the survival of species on land and in the ocean. These risks 
			increase as temperatures climb. Exacerbated by climate change, the world is losing species at 
			a rate 1,000 times greater than at any other time in recorded human history. One million species 
			are at risk of becoming extinct within the next few decades. Forest fires, extreme weather, and 
			invasive pests and diseases are among many threats related to climate change. Some species will 
			be able to relocate and survive, but others will not.<br><br>

			 <h2>Not Enough Food</h2>
			 Changes in the climate and increases in extreme weather events are among the reasons behind a 
			 global rise in hunger and poor nutrition. Fisheries, crops, and livestock may be destroyed or 
			 become less productive. With the ocean becoming more acidic, marine resources that feed billions 
			 of people are at risk. Changes in snow and ice cover in many Arctic regions have disrupted food 
			 supplies from herding, hunting, and fishing. Heat stress can diminish water and grasslands for 
			 grazing, causing declining crop yields and affecting livestock.<br><br>

			<h2>More health risks</h2>
			Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity. Climate impacts are already 
			harming health, through air pollution, disease, extreme weather events, forced displacement, 
			pressures on mental health, and increased hunger and poor nutrition in places where people cannot 
			grow or find sufficient food. Every year, environmental factors take the lives of around 13 
			million people. Changing weather patterns are expanding diseases, and extreme weather events 
			increase deaths and make it difficult for health care systems to keep up.<br><br>


			<h2>Poverty and displacement</h2>
			Climate change increases the factors that put and keep people in poverty. Floods may sweep away 
			urban slums, destroying homes and livelihoods. Heat can make it difficult to work in outdoor jobs.
			 Water scarcity may affect crops. Over the past decade (2010â€“2019), weather-related events 
			 displaced an estimated 23.1 million people on average each year, leaving many more vulnerable 
			 to poverty. Most refugees come from countries that are most vulnerable and least ready to 
			 adapt to the impacts of climate change.<br><br>
