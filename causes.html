			<h2>Generating power</h2>
			

			Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels causes a large chunk of 
			global emissions. Most electricity is still generated by burning coal, oil, or gas, 
			which produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide – powerful greenhouse gases that blanket 
			the Earth and trap the sun’s heat. Globally, a bit more than a quarter of electricity comes 
			from wind, solar and other renewable sources which, as opposed to fossil fuels, emit little 
			to no greenhouse gases or pollutants into the air.<br><br>

			<h2>Manufacturing goods</h2>
			Manufacturing and industry produce emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels to
			 produce energy for making things like cement, iron, steel, electronics, plastics, 
			 clothes, and other goods. Mining and other industrial processes also release gases, 
			 as does the construction industry. Machines used in the manufacturing process often 
			 run on coal, oil, or gas; and some materials, like plastics, are made from chemicals 
			 sourced from fossil fuels. The manufacturing industry is one of the largest contributors 
			 to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.<br><br>


			 <h2>Cutting down of Trees</h2>
			 Cutting down forests to create farms or pastures, or for other reasons, causes
			  emissions, since trees, when they are cut, release the carbon they have been storing. 
			  Each year approximately 12 million hectares of forest are destroyed. Since forests absorb 
			  carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits nature’s ability to keep emissions out of the 
			  atmosphere. Deforestation, together with agriculture and other land use changes, is responsible 
			  for roughly a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br>

			<h2>Using Transportation</h2>
			Most cars, trucks, ships, and planes run on fossil fuels. That makes transportation 
			a major contributor of greenhouse gases, especially carbon-dioxide emissions. Road 
			vehicles account for the largest part, due to the combustion of petroleum-based products, 
			like gasoline, in internal combustion engines. But emissions from ships and planes continue 
			to grow. Transport accounts for nearly one quarter of global energy-related carbon-dioxide 
			emissions. And trends point to a significant increase in energy use for transport over the 
			coming years.<br><br>

			<h2>Producing Food</h2>
			Producing food causes emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases 
			in various ways, including through deforestation and clearing of land for agriculture 
			and grazing, digestion by cows and sheep, the production and use of fertilizers and manure 
			for growing crops, and the use of energy to run farm equipment or fishing boats, usually with
			 fossil fuels. All this makes food production a major contributor to climate change. And 
			 greenhouse gas emissions also come from packaging and distributing food.<br><br>

			 <h2>Powering buildings</h2>
			 Globally, residential and commercial buildings consume over half of all electricity. As they 
			 continue to draw on coal, oil, and natural gas for heating and cooling, they emit significant 
			 quantities of greenhouse gas emissions. Growing energy demand for heating and cooling, with 
			 rising air-conditioner ownership, as well as increased electricity consumption for lighting, 
			 appliances, and connected devices, has contributed to a rise in energy-related carbon-dioxide 
			 emissions from buildings in recent years.<br><br>

			<h2>Consuming too much</h2>
			Your home and use of power, how you move around, what you eat and how much you throw away all 
			contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. So does the consumption of goods such as clothing, 
			electronics, and plastics. A large chunk of global greenhouse gas emissions are linked to private
			households. Our lifestyles have a profound impact on our planet. The wealthiest bear the greatest 
			responsibility: the richest 1 per cent of the global population combined account for more 
			greenhouse gas emissions than the poorest 50 per cent.<br><br>
